# Project - Visualising Exchange Rates
Explanatory data visualisation which makes use of:
- Storytelling data visualizations
- High data-ink ratio
- Gestalt principles of design

## Message
The visualisation will show **The Impact of Prime Ministers on Euro Exchange Rates**

## Method
The following Gestalt principles will be use:
- Continuation
- Similarity
to create a **journey** for the viewer.

## Design
- 4 charts showing 4 periods of Euro exchange rates under Labour + 3 different Tory PMs.
- 1 base chart is repeated 4 times.
- A chart is layered on top for each of the periods above.
- 4 key events in UK economics and domestic policy are indicated, one on each graph

## Summary
**Gestalt principles** of design - continuation and similarity - create a feeling of decline.

**Intentionally emotive**, and certainly not good journalism, the descending line of continuation adds a feeling of decline to the chart which is 100% intentional.

**Data:Ink** ratio is very high, making use of only the shape of the exchange rate chart and the historical trend line of the mean exchange rate to give numerical relation.
